## About Aimmish
- Forked from RootKit's AI Aimbot to add optimizations and such...
- Supports any YOLOV5 model given to it but only comes with Fortnite related models
- Fully undetected in Fortnite, bypassing both EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) and BE (BattlEye)
- Written in full Python, not compiled to an EXE though but don't worry it's really easy to install
- **Does not support host shields, but should still be undetected on Fortnite**
- To use this in other games, see this project: [Aimmy Arduino Edition](https://github.com/Seconb/Aimmy-Arduino-Edition)
- REQUIRES AN ARDUINO LEONARDO R3!!!!!

## Video Setup Guide
- Do not DM me on Discord for help, use GitHub issues if you have any problems.
- [Video Tutorial Link](https://streamable.com/srqx16)
- [Arduino IDE Download](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe)
- [Python Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.10/python-3.9.10-amd64.exe)

## Troubleshooting
- Do not DM me on Discord. Seriously.
- Make sure that you clicked "install" to everything when you installed Arduino IDE
- If the pip install thing doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall Python making sure you check "Add Python.exe to PATH" when you install it. In addition, make sure another version of Python already installed on your PC isn't causing issues.
- If the Arduino script doesn't decompile, then make sure you're waiting a few seconds before you press the "RESET" button on your Arduino Leonardo R3
